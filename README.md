# Challenge information:

Take a look at the example we made:
https://assessment-example.vercel.app/


**Goal**: Make a compelling text game with multiple branches and endings.
Feel free to use frameworks if you feel that will make things easier.

> New to coding, and don't know what's going on? Don't try to understand everything, just the pieces that you need to build with.

Extra information:
---

``button.classList.add('btn')``
This adds a class of btn to the button. This can be useful for styling purposes.

``setState``

Multiple states can be used, if seperated by a comma.
